# CZellars_python_project_CIS351
This Python project will retrieve and display data from an external API to produce meaningful results. In addition to demonstrating proficiency with API integration and data handling, the project will incorporate key principles of the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability). Security measures will be implemented to ensure only authorized access, protect data from tampering, and maintain reliable operation of the program.
